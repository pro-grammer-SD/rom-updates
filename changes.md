# Version 1.0.3 `aka. The End`

- Sorry, but to all users, I have been very grateful but sadly, I have to shut down this project with a heavy heart. I know, you might have loved this project, but all the time, it was just a test. I am making a huge high-grade app that I'll release soon, so please don't worry. I hope you will love it. As a loving memory, I'm keeping the update server and the app content alive. Stay well, dear users! 👍✅
- *Please ignore this update, it has no new downloads.*😶‍🌫️

# Version 1.0.2

- Updated with a **NEW** feature-filled updater
- Under `Properties` ([Alt]+[Enter]) , in the `Compability` tab , check `Run this program as an administrator` and select `Apply` and then hit `OK` and close. Or else the Updater will throw an error dialog box.
